# Solar Physics Projects 💡  

Welcome to my Solar Physics Projects repository! This repository showcases my research and expertise in analyzing solar and geomagnetic activity using advanced programming and analysis techniques.

## Key Projects  

### 1. [The Impact of Polarity of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) on Solar Wind and Geomagnetic Indices Through Five Solar Cycles (20-24)](https://github.com/76basant/Solar-Physics-Projects/tree/3e425df82efdad6bffaefede083d43ef5a769154/Toward%20and%20Away%20Direction%20of%20IMF)
- **Description**:  
  This project examines the response of solar wind parameters (e.g., speed, pressure, and density) and geomagnetic indices (e.g., Dst and Ap) to the polarity of the IMF during the last five solar cycles (20-24).  
- **Programming Languages**:  
  Python, MATLAB

Here are some of my key projects that showcase my skills and expertise:

1. **[The impact of polarity interplanatery magnetic filed IMF on solar wind and geomagnetic indices through five solar cycles 20-24](https://github.com/76basant/Solar-Physics-Projects/tree/3e425df82efdad6bffaefede083d43ef5a769154/Toward%20and%20Away%20Direction%20of%20IMF)**:
- Description: studied the response of solar wind parameters, like speed, pressure, density and geomagnetic indices, such as Dst and Ap to the polarity of IMF during the last five solar cycles, 20-24.
   - Programming Languages:
 Python & Matlab
   - Analysis techniques: 
Running correlation & Wavelet & cross-wavelet & wavelet-coherence 
 
2. **[The interconnection between geomagnetic indices based on asymmetry of the solar activity" investigated the impact of unequal distribution of solar activity on geomagnetic disturbances during the last four solar cycles, 21-24](https://github.com/76basant/Solar-Physics-Projects/tree/main/Lomb%20Scargle%20Periodagram%20of%20SSA%20)**:

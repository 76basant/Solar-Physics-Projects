Here are some of my key projects that showcase my skills and expertise:

1. **[Toward and Away Direction of IMF ](https://github.com/76basant/Solar-Physics-Projects/tree/3e425df82efdad6bffaefede083d43ef5a769154/Toward%20and%20Away%20Direction%20of%20IMF)**: Splitting IMF Direction into Toward and Away.
   - Subitem 1: Explanation of the method
   - Subitem 2: Data analysis approach
   - Subitem 3: Results and findings
2. **[Lomb Scargle Periodagram of Sunspot Area](https://github.com/76basant/Solar-Physics-Projects/tree/3e425df82efdad6bffaefede083d43ef5a769154/Toward%20and%20Away%20Direction%20of%20IMF)**: Detection Periodicities using the Scargle Periodagram of Sunspot Area from cycles 21 to 24.
